# 📚 Data Science with Codanics - My Learning Journey 🚀

> This repository contains my personal learning journey of 6 months in **Python, Data Science, and Machine Learning** using the **Codanics Course**.

---

## 🧠 What I’ve Learned So Far:

### ✅ Python Programming:
- Basics of Python: variables, data types, loops, functions
- File handling, modules, error handling

### ✅ Data Analysis Libraries:
- **NumPy** – numerical computations
- **Pandas** – data wrangling and analysis
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** – data visualization

### ✅ Mathematics for ML:
- Basic algebra and linear equations
- Matrices, functions, and number theory

### ✅ Statistics for Data Science:
- Mean, median, mode
- Standard deviation, variance, distribution
- Probability and Z-score

### 📦 Currently Learning:
- **Machine Learning** basics
- Missing value treatment, data inconsistencies
- Outlier detection and data preprocessing
